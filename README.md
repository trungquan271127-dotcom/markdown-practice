#  MY PROJECT

Markdown is a simple yet **powerful tool** and *very easy to learn*. It allows us to format plain text effortlessly.

## ✅ REQUIRED FORMATTING FEATURES

### 1. Lists and Links

This section demonstrates the required list types:

* Unordered List Item 1 (using `*`).
* Unordered List Item 2 (using `*`).

The steps taken were:

1. Created a Public Repository.
2. Edited the README.md file.

For more detailed information, visit the official [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en).

### 2. Code Examples

We use **inline code** for short commands like `git status`. For longer code blocks, use the following code for a simple calculation:

```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    # Calculate the area of a rectangle
    area = length * width
    return area

print(calculate_area(5, 10))
